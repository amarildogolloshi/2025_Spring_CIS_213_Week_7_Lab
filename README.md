# Movie App

## Introduction

Now that we know how to route to different "virtual" pages (i.e., views) in React, letâ€™s start building the structure for a new app: **Movie App**.

## Objective

For now, we'll focus on creating the scaffolding for the app's views, which we'll further develop in upcoming assignments. The goal is to have these components using a basic design that allows the user to navigate to each one. Additionally, apply what you've learned with children props to create a reusable layout.

## Views

### Home

The landing page where users will start.

### Movies

The page where we'll display movie details (this is the one you've already created).

### Now Playing

A new page that will show currently playing movies, pulled from an API. (Check out the [API documentation](#) here).

### About/Contact

A page that you can customize with whatever content you'd like.
